# Mapbase Model Sources

This repository contains most of Mapbase's model and animation source files, primarily `.qc`, `.qci`, `.smd`, and `.blend` files.

The main tools used to create these models and animations were Crowbar, Blender, and Notepad++. The state of these are provided as
they were used during development and there may be a few areas which are messy or otherwise difficult to read or understand.

As with the rest of Mapbase, **leaked content was NOT involved with the creation of these models or animations**.

This repository accepts pull requests for contributing models to Mapbase.

Most of these source files are derived from decompiled Half-Life 2, Half-Life 2: Episode One, Half-Life 2: Episode Two, or Half-Life 2: Deathmatch content.

Crowbar was used to decompile those models.

The following model sources or directories are from other external sources:

* `hl2mp_ported_anims` - All files in this directory come from samples distributed as part of the Source SDK.
* `ChoreoModels` - The `body_poses_lean` and `bodyrules_xsi` files come from samples distributed as part of the Source SDK.
