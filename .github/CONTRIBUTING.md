This file details how to contribute to Mapbase's model sources.

If you wish to contribute to Mapbase in some other way, see Mapbase's original Source 2013 repo:
	https://github.com/mapbase-source/source-sdk-2013

---

This repository accepts pull requests for new model/animation sources or changes to existing model/animation sources.

All changes will be reflected in future updates and will be used in mods and maps using Mapbase. As a result, this repo
holds itself to a similar standard as that of the code repository.

All contributions must follow the following rules:

 * A contribution must be aligned with Mapbase's goals and priorities and should not be "subjective"
   or related to a specific mod or type of mod. For example, fixing an existing issue or adding a
   new tool for mappers to use is usually fine, but adding a new custom weapon with its own assets
   is usually not fit for Mapbase.
   
 * All content in a contribution must be either already legally open-source or done with the
   full permission of the content's original creator(s).
   
 * Contributions must not break existing maps/content or interfere with them in a negative or non-objective way.
   
Contributions which do not follow these guidelines cannot be accepted into Mapbase.

Attempting to contribute content which seriously violates the rules above can lead to being blocked from contributing,
especially if done repeatedly.
